Git Plugin 4.x and Git Client Plugin 3.x are ready for another beta release.  All known regressions are resolved in the git client plugin 3.0 milestone https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/milestone/1?closed=1 and in the git plugin 4.0 milestone https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/milestone/3?closed=1 .  The new beta release will be delivered this week.  After about a month of successful beta testing, it will be time to release them.  If new regressions are detected, that will delay the release.

Git Plugin 4.x and Git Client Plugin 3.x include some breaking changes (JGit 5.4 is included which has a breaking API change compared to the currently delivered JGit 4.5, removal of an Apache contrib SSL factory class that never should have been in the API, etc.).  Testing is welcomed.""","Task 3 of 10""Hi, I was wondering if it's possible to have dynamic values in the yaml file.  Here's my scenario: I am using CloudBees Core and have created a Master image from the one CloudBees provides.  In my Dockerfile, I install JCasC and throw in my own jenkins.yaml file so each Master is preconfigured.  The configuration is all static at the moment.  I'd like to add in preconfigured nodes as well. The nodes are all hosted on the same machine. My issue here is that the node on each Master needs to point to a different location for the root of its workspace.  I can use anything, and up until now have been running a script to configure them with a workspace that incorporates the Master's name.  Is there a way to have my jenkins.yaml have a variable/dynamic value that gets replaced?  Thanks!""","Task 4 of 10""@user I think a bit of both. 
I do not understand the difference between yaml and yamls, and the kubernetes demo didn't had an example for me to rely on.

The kubernetes plugin maintainer mentioned in the documentation that the template format is deprecated. With that in mind, I guess it would've been helpful for more examples to be around with the usage of the Raw yaml pod declaration.

PS: I've also had to uninstall AWS related plugins from Jenkins because it was giving me an error every time I was loading the file with environment variables on it. I'll try to make a issue on it in the future if it's not a known issue (I didn't find anything related to this in issues).
PPS: Environment Variables had to be quoted, else they would not be loaded. From the documentation I got the sense that I didn't had to quote them.""","Task 5 of 10
""I've got a bunch of credentials in our old Jenkins instance that I need to get exported and setup in my new Jenkins instance using JCasC... We're using AWS SSM Parameter Store to place the credentials in and referencing in JCasC using the ssm-secrets plugin... anyone know if there's an easy way using the script console to parse through the credential store(s) and export out the credentials so they could be entered into SSM Parameter Store?

""@casz thx - i think really my question is this. i am able, through removing sections of my yaml and repeated runs, to narrow down where I have made a mistake. The yaml passes an online validation tool in terms of indentation, but jenkins spits it back out and doesn't give a line number - it's often just a general error about the fact that it's iterating through a hash map and get's an exception. so this seems like a bit of a pain to me - that in terms of debugging we don't even have the basic facility such as a printf or something to help identify where the problem is. it's just take stuff out the file until it starts working again and then try to figure it out. so i would consider trying to write a small tool to do this job of prevalidation - and open a PR for for it - but wanted to check on this channel that there wasn't already something that would do that job. a --dry-run for jcasc?""","Task 7 of 10""It's same thing I tell our devs when they complain about `git clone/fetch/pull` doesn't work and they start doing  `git config http.sslVerify false` :hear_no_evil: 
Like giving away any respect and trust you have in the system because you don't know how to spend two minutes to figure out how to actually trust https connection with your git client.

On windows you would install git with schannel enabled so that it will use the windows certifciate store so that IT can roll out our root certificate that git than would trust.
Or on linux/mac actually add the certificate to the system OS's trusted certificates... All of this takes less time and can be setup once.

I swear by solving these things as code instead of spending hours and days maintaining stupid documentation on these subjects that nobody reads.

""@user thank you for your help. Indeed, I am using bitbucket-branch-source-plugin. And indeed, this plugin scans the project to detect desired repos and add a hook on it to trigger build after a push. So you say that the feature I want (i.e. being able to scan repositories to list them in Jenkins but without triggering builds) must be implemented at plugin level: ok, I will do a PR for that. 
But what I do not understand is the difference of behaviour for the same action in GUI and via JCasC:  when creating an new item """"Bitbucket Team"""" in the GUI, configuring it and saving it, it creates the folder and a scan is automatically launched to detect repos and the corresponding builds are triggered. However when I do the same item creation by loading JCasC YAML file (with `jobs` section), it creates the folder but the scan is **not** launched automatically (I have either to manually launch it by clicking on """"Scan Organization Folder Now"""" or wait for the periodically trigger if it is configured).

I have been stuck at an issue for several hours with no respite and I need help!

I have religiously followed all the recommended suggestions and its becoming a little bit tiring.

So, I am following the official recommendations of adding firebase to a brand new flutter project.
But here is the catch: I cant afford to serve only 21 SDKs and above.
So, I am hit with the dex limits simply by adding a few official firebase plugins. One of the overriding suggestions was to accomodate more than one dex files...sounds neat but for some weird reasons, all recommended steps seemed to work for others but me.
But there is another suggestion, that I reduce the amount of methods by importing only the plugins I use.
This sounds neater and the best route in my opinion but still, I cant make it work.
Note that this is a brand new project with no pre-existing legacy to interfare.

Just about 4 standard plugins on an empty project triggring 64K method limits.
Isn't that weird? Now, if I am not the only one with these concerns, why is there no clear-cut solutions to these glaring gotchas?
Why is there no official steps-by-step instructions that actually work?

I am sorry to come on here and post a rant, but I am wearied with all of these unforeseen gotchas.

Right now, I will take all the help I can get.
Here again is my scenario:
1. I want to support at least >18 SDK
2. I would like to reduce the amount of imported firebase/google services
